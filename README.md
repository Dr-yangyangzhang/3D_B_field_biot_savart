# 3D_B_field_biot_savart
## The bacis idea is to apply the Biot-Savart's law.
- Note that here we neglect the volume of the coils. 
- This calculation needs numpy and the visulisation needs mayavi.
- For now, this code could only deal with circular coils and/or straight wires. And the normal direction of the circular coils should be parallel to either of the three axes (x,y,z). Further modification will be applied to any direction.
- It should be simple to modify to get the B field generated by a arc coil.
